    How does the algorithm work?
    It picks some value as a pivot.
    Reorders the array such that values lower or equal to the pivot are placed before it (lower subarray)
    Values greater than the pivot are placed after it (higher subarray)
    This process is called partitioning. Using Hoare partition scheme.
    The algorithm recursively sorts each of the subarrays.
    Each subarray is further divided into the next two subarrays and so on.
    The recursion stops when there are one or zero elements left in a subarray.
